# SOAR IREC 2018 Payload
Payload for the 2018 IREC Rocket
Produced by the Student Organization for Aerospace Research (SOAR)
________________________________

Developed for the Tenseey 3.5 Microcontroller and two Arduino Nano Microcontrollers. 

The Payload does the following things:
1. Measures the spin rate of the rocket using photoresistors
2. Measures the temperature profile of the nose cone using thermistors
3. Measures the speed of the rocket using a pitot tube
4. Measures the amount of ionizing radiation using Geiger tubes
5. Measures the effectiveness of custom made radiation shielding material

The Arduino Nanos are cheap clones, and you may not have the drivers necessary. See https://rastating.github.io/installing-drivers-for-an-arduino-nano-in-windows/ if you are having difficulties.
