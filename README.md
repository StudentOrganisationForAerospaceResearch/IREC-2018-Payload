# SOAR IREC 2018 Payload
Payload for the 2018 IREC Rocket
Produced by the Student Organization for Aerospace Research (SOAR)
________________________________

Developed for the Tenseey 3.5 Microcontroller and two Arduino Nano Microcontrollers. The Payload does the following things:
1. Measures the spin rate of the rocket using photoresitors
2. Measures the temperature profile of the nose cone using thermistors
3. Measures the speed of the rocket using a pitiot tube
4. Measures the amount of ionizing radiation using a geiger tubes
5. Measures the effictivness of custom made radiation shielding material

The Arduino nano's are cheap clones, and you may not have the drivers necessaracy. See https://rastating.github.io/installing-drivers-for-an-arduino-nano-in-windows/ if you are having difficulties.
